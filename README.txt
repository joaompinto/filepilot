# README.txt

This file contains a brief description of the project and its contents.

## Project Overview

Filepilot is an AI-powered tool that allows you to create, analyze, and modify files using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Anthropic Claude AI model. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the AI assistant and performing various file operations based on your instructions.

## Features

- **File Creation**: Generate new files based on a description, with the ability to provide reference files or content as context.
- **File Modification**: Modify existing files by providing instructions to the AI assistant, such as adding, removing, or updating code sections.
- **File Analysis**: Analyze files and obtain insights or recommendations from the AI assistant based on specific prompts.
- **Visual Diff**: View a visual representation of the differences between two files, highlighting the changes made.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/filepilot.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up your Anthropic API key as an environment variable: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

## Usage

To start the Filepilot CLI, run the following command:

```
python -m filepilot
```

This will display the available commands and options. You can use the `--help` flag to get more information about each command.

For example, to create a new file based on a description, run:

```
python -m filepilot create-file "Create a Python file that defines a simple function to calculate the factorial of a given number" --reference-files=path/to/reference_file.py
```
